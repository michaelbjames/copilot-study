At the end of each session we asked the participant the following questions:

- How do you decide which snippets to accept and which to reject?
- What could Copilot do differently to help you more?
- Did you change your coding style to integrate Copilot in your workflow? If so, how?
- How much did you trust Copilot? What should Copilot do to make you trust it more?
- What type of programming tasks do you find Copilot most useful for?
- What size code suggestions do you like getting from Copilot? Does context matter?
- If you like blocks of code as a suggestion, would you prefer to get it
    line-by-line or all-at-once?
- How do you like to get your Copilot suggestions? Does context matter?
- In what ways do you prefer to invoke Copilot? Does context matter?
